Locks to be implemented in the userSimulator function
In the userSimulation function, the following lines of code need to be enclosed in locks:

Accessing and modifying the graph data structure
Accessing and modifying the mp map
Adding an Action to the AQueue data structure


like this:

// Create a mutex lock
pthread_mutex_t mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

// ...

void *userSimulator(void *arg)
{
    // ...
    
    // Acquire the lock before accessing/modifying the graph data structure
    pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
    
    // Access and modify the graph data structure
    // ...
    
    // Release the lock after modifying the graph data structure
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
    
    // ...
    
    // Acquire the lock before accessing/modifying the mp map
    pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
    
    // Access and modify the mp map
    // ...
    
    // Release the lock after modifying the mp map
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
    
    // ...
    
    // Acquire the lock before adding an Action to the AQueue data structure
    pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
    
    // Add an Action to the AQueue data structure
    // ...
    
    // Release the lock after adding the Action to the AQueue data structure
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);

Based on the code provided, here are some suggestions for where to implement locks:

When reading from the file: Since multiple threads will be accessing the same file, you should use a lock to ensure that only one thread reads from the file at a time. You can put a lock around the getline(infile, line) statement to achieve this.

When updating the graph: Since multiple threads may be updating the same graph at the same time, you should use a lock to ensure that only one thread updates the graph at a time. You can put a lock around the code that updates the graph, specifically around the graph.count(id1) and graph.count(id2) statements.

When accessing the test data structure: Since multiple threads may be accessing the same test data structure at the same time, you should use a lock to ensure that only one thread accesses the test data structure at a time. You can put a lock around the test[id1].insert(id2) and test[id2].insert(id1) statements.

When creating UserSimulator Threads: Since multiple threads may be creating UserSimulator threads at the same time, you should use a lock to ensure that only one thread creates UserSimulator threads at a time. You can put a lock around the for loop that creates UserSimulator threads.

When accessing the graph data structure for debugging purposes: Since multiple threads may be accessing the same graph data structure at the same time, you should use a lock to ensure that only one thread accesses the graph data structure at a time. You can put a lock around the code that writes to the output_graph.txt file and the degree.txt file.

to store the priority for the readPost thread functionality, we can create a map of nodes to priority values. The priority value for each node will be calculated as follows:

For each node, find the set of its neighbors.
For each neighbor, find the set of its neighbors.
Count the number of common nodes between the two sets of neighbors.
Set the priority value for the node as the count of common nodes.
Here's an algorithm in C++ that implements this:

// Map of nodes to priority values

map<int, int> nodePriority;

// For each node in the graph
for(auto node : graph) {
    Node n = node.second; // implement Equal to Operator
    int nodeId = node.second.user_id;
    map<int,int> neighbors = node.second.getNeighbors();
    int priority = 0;
    
    // For each neighbor of the node
    for(auto& [neighborId, f] : neighbors) {
        map<int,int> neighborNeighbors = graph[neighborId].getNeighbors();
        
        // Count the number of common nodes between the two sets of neighbors
        int commonNeighbors = 0;
        for(auto& [neighborNeighborId,g] : neighborNeighbors) {
            if(neighbors.count(neighborNeighborId) > 0) {
                commonNeighbors++;
            }
        }
        
        // Add the count of common nodes to the priority value
        priority += commonNeighbors;
    }
    
    // Set the priority value for the node
    nodePriority[nodeId] = priority;
}
Once we have the priority values for each node, we can use them to order the actions in the readPost thread according to priority.

 we can implement a similar approach to read posts in chronological order. We can use a priority queue to store the posts in chronological order based on the timestamp, and then deque the posts from the priority queue.

Here's an example implementation:

********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

// Define a custom comparator to sort posts by timestamp
struct PostComparator {
    bool operator()(const Post& p1, const Post& p2) const {
        return p1.timestamp > p2.timestamp;
    }
};

// Create a priority queue to store posts in chronological order
priority_queue<Post, vector<Post>, PostComparator> postQueue;

// For each node in the graph
for(auto& [nodeId, node] : graph) {
    map<int, set<int>> posts = node.getPosts();

    // For each post of the node
    for(auto& [postId, post] : posts) {
        postQueue.push(post);
    }
}

// Deque posts from the priority queue in chronological order
while(!postQueue.empty()) {
    Post post = postQueue.top();
    postQueue.pop();
    int postId = post.post_id;
    int userId = post.user_id;
    int actionType = post.action_type;
    int timestamp = post.timestamp;
    string message = "I read action number " + to_string(postId) + " of type " + to_string(actionType) + " posted by user " + to_string(userId) + " at time " + to_string(timestamp);
    logMessage(message);
    cout << message << endl;
}
This implementation creates a priority queue of Post objects sorted by their timestamp field, and then dequeues the posts in chronological order by popping them from the priority queue. It also logs and prints a message for each post that is dequeued.

    // Set the priority value for the node
    nodePriority[nodeId] = priority;
}
